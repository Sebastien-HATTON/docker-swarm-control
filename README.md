# Overview
This project is a showcase of how to use the new Docker Swarm mode, driving it through Docker Compose.

# Prerequisites

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed and working
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed and working
* [VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed into VirtualBox
* **[Virtualization support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization) enabled in your BIOS**
* a working internet connection
* Your corporate VPN running (if you want to apply some work-specific plays)

# Building
All the components of the environment live in repositories on the internet so there is nothing to build.

# Installation
1. `vagrant ssh node-1` -- all commands are done from the master node
1. `scripts/01-create-swarm.sh` -- you will have to enter the password for each ssh session
1. `scripts/02-create-overlay-network.sh` -- no longer needed!
1. `scripts/03-deploy-global-service.sh` -- creates a stack that has service where one instance runs on all nodes
1. `scripts/04-destroy-global-service.sh` -- destroys the stack, freeing resources
1. `scripts/05-deploy-replicated-service.sh` -- creates a stack were services get placed randomly by the scheduler and scaled
1. `scripts/06-destroy-replicated-service.sh` -- cleans up the stack we just created
1. `scripts/07-deploy-rolling-upgrade.sh` -- showcase an upgrade of Redis from one release to another
1. `scripts/08-destroy-rolling-upgrade.sh` -- cleans up the upgrade stack
